        <li><a class="tracker-id" href="gemini://bbs.geminispace.org/s/Rosy-Crow-Issues/41">#41</a> This makes it so that multiple tabs won't all spam overlapping alerts on startup</li>

    <li>A number of tab-related features can be accessed by long-pressing on a tab

  <p>In the Settings menu you'll find a switch to enable custom font sizes.  There are four sizes to adjust: body text and the three levels of heading that Gemtext supports.</p>

  <h5>Regressions</h5>
  <p>Due to breaking changes in the MAUI framework, the URL entry can no longer be smoothly animated as it had previously been.  This is something that I'll be keeping an eye on in the hopes of fixing in the foreseeable future.</p>
