  <h5>Tabs <a class="tracker-id" href="gemini://bbs.geminispace.org/s/Rosy-Crow-Issues/27">#27</a></h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Tabs will now appear along the bottom of the screen</li>
    <li>Swiping left and right in the app will navigate through the open tabs</li>
    <li>A number of tab-related features can be accessed by long-pressing on a tab</li>

  <h5>Other changes</h5>
  <ul>

    <li><a class="tracker-id" href="gemini://bbs.geminispace.org/s/Rosy-Crow-Issues/24">#24</a> Gemini links in other apps can now be opened in Rosy Crow</li>

  </ul>
  <h5>Regressions</h5>
  <p>Due to breaking changes in the MAUI framework, the URL entry can no longer be smoothly animated as it had previously been.  This is something that I'll be keeping an eye on in the hopes of fixing in the foreseeable future.</p>
